// Write a function that always returns 5
//
// Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/
//
// Good luck :)
//p function, array or string that has a length of 5
//R get value 5 without using numbers or characters 0123456789*+-/
//E ["","","","",""]
//Pseudo make an array that returns the value five and get the length to return 5
function unusualFive() {
  let array = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
  return array.length
}
